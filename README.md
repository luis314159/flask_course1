# Flask Learning Resources Repository

Welcome to my Flask Learning Resources Repository! This repository is dedicated to compiling notes, code examples, and exercises from my journey of learning Flask, a powerful web framework for Python. The materials here are primarily based on the following resources:

1. **Book**: *Flask Web Development* by Miguel Grinberg, O'Reilly Media  
   - This book offers a comprehensive guide to developing web applications using Flask, covering everything from the basics to more advanced topics.
   - [More about the book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/flask-web-development/9781491991725/)

2. **Courses**:
   - [Flask Course on Platzi](https://platzi.com/cursos/flask/)  
     This course provides a solid foundation for understanding Flask and building your own web applications, from basic concepts to deployment.
     
   - [Python and Flask Bootcamp: Create Websites using Flask on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-flask-bootcamp-create-websites-using-flask/)  
     This bootcamp-style course on Udemy offers hands-on experience in building full-fledged web applications with Flask, covering a range of topics including REST APIs, authentication, and deployment.

In this repository, you'll find organized notes, explanations, and example projects that I've developed while studying these materials. Feel free to explore, contribute, and use these resources to enhance your own Flask skills!
